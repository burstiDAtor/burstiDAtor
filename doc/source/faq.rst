Frequently Asked/Anticipated Questions
======================================

- Why is the program called 'burstiDAtor'?
    + It is a reference to the character 'Trogdor the Burninator' in the Homestar Runner series. The capitalization of 'DA' refers to dopamine, a neurotransmitter released by cells of which the neural burst response profiles can be analyzed using burstiDAtor. 
      Earlier versions were named 'Vucmoore the bustiDAtor', which rhymed better with the full name of Trogdor. For reasons of simplicity, amongst other things, it was shortened to its current name.

.. _`burst_detection`:

- How is a burst detected?
    + Assuming spikes have already been detected using another program (such as Spike2), a burst is defined according to the criteria proposed by [GB84]_. A burst start when two consective spikes have are less than 80 ms apart. Every subsequent spike less than 160 ms from the previous spike is part of the burst, too. A burst ends when two consecutive spikes are more than 160 ms apart.

- Which file formats are supported?
    + Currently only wavemark text files (which can be generated by Spike2) are supported. If you need support for other formats, do not hesitate to :ref:`contact us <contact_the_authors>`.

- How should I cite burstiDAtor?
    + See [OO13]_

- Under what license is burstiDAtor provided?
    + Under the MIT license (see :ref:`license`; the COPYING file in the source, or the 'about' section if you are using a Java archive ``.jar`` file). The exact legal terms are described in the license, but it roughly means that you can use the software freely however you want and that you can share the program with others and/or improve on it, as long as you do not remove copyright notices and do not sue us for unexpected or unwanted behaviour.
