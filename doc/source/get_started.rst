===========

burstiDAtor runs in two environments, Java and Matlab/Octave. Both environments support similar functionality, though the latter does not support writing text output files at the moment.

Java
----
The most convenient way to use burstiDAtor is to use a ``.jar`` (java archive) file rom https://github.com/nno/burstiDAtor/releases.

Alternatively, download the code from github (https://github.com/nno/burstiDAtor) and compile the .java files in the ``java`` directory.

Matlab
------
Download the code from github; the functions are in the ``matlab`` directory
